# Climate Data Analysis

This repository contains Python code for analyzing historical climate data using time series analysis techniques.

## Overview

The project aims to explore and understand historical climate patterns and trends by analyzing data from various time intervals, including hourly, three-hourly, daily, and monthly data. The code performs exploratory data analysis and generates visualizations to uncover insights into climate conditions over time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- tkinter (for the GUI interface)

## Instructions

1. Ensure Python and the required libraries are installed.
2. Clone the repository: `[https://github.com/YourUsername/Climate-Data-Analysis](https://github.com/Afinz0z/Climate-Data-Analysis)`
3. Navigate to the directory containing the code.
4. Run the script: `python Main.py`
5. Select the CSV file containing the climate data you want to analyze from the dropdown menu.
6. Choose the parameter (e.g., temperature, precipitation) you want to analyze from the dropdown menu.
7. Click the "Plot Trend" button to generate a plot showing the trend of the selected parameter over time.
8. Analyze the generated plot to observe patterns and trends in the selected climate parameter.
9. Repeat the analysis by selecting different CSV files and parameters and clicking the "Plot Trend" button again.
10. Close the application window when finished.

### Note:
- Ensure that the CSV files are correctly formatted and contain the necessary data columns.
- Adjust the code paths and column names in the script if your data files have different names or structures.
- If you encounter any issues or errors, refer to the error messages displayed in the terminal/command prompt for troubleshooting.
